        <h1 id="Info">Here's a time line of Amy's life:</h1>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li >1983 - born in <em>London, England</em></li>
            <li>1992 - She and her elder brother, Alex, were raised primarily by their mother, a pharmacist, who divorced their father, a taxicab driver, when Winehouse was 9 years old.</li>
            <li>1999 - Early on she demonstrated an interest in the arts, but she was reportedly expelled from the Sylvia Young Theatre School for wearing a forbidden nose ring. Young, the school’s founder, repeatedly denied that Winehouse had been expelled, though the story continued to circulate as part of the mythology of the singer’s inclination for rebelliousness. At the prestigious BRIT School (a school for the performing and creative arts), Winehouse showed ability as an actor as well as a singer, and by age 16 she was performing with jazz groups.</li>
            <li>2003 - Amy Winehouse's debut album <i>Frank</i> highlighted her sharp lyrics and smoky vocals, earning comparisons to jazz legends, though she later expressed her dislike for the album.</li>
            <li id="back">2006 (<i>Back To Black</i>) - “Back to Black” is one of Amy Winehouse’s most famous songs, and its story reflects a period of deep emotional turmoil in her life. The song was released as the title track of her 2006 album, Back to Black.

                The lyrics of "Back to Black" are a poignant reflection on heartbreak and loss. Winehouse wrote the song during a time when she was grappling with the end of her relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil, which was marked by constant ups and downs. The song captures the sense of despair and resignation she felt as she faced the reality of losing a loved one and the return to a darker emotional state.
                
                In the song, Winehouse sings about the end of a relationship and the painful return to a life of loneliness and melancholy, described metaphorically as "back to black." The mood of the song is somber and reflective, with its classic soul sound underscoring the raw emotion in her voice. The song's rich, melancholic melody and heartfelt lyrics contributed to its critical acclaim and helped cement Winehouse's reputation as a talented and deeply expressive artist.</li>
            <li>2011 - Despite Winehouse’s many troubles, her remarkable musical talent was regarded as undeniable by fans and critics alike. However, her life seemed to continue to spin out of control. Although she entered rehab, she did not remain long, and reports of substance use continued to follow her. In July 2009 she and Fielder-Civil divorced. Two years later Winehouse attempted a comeback tour, but it was canceled after the singer appeared to be intoxicated at the opening concert. She died from alcohol poisoning the following month.</li>
